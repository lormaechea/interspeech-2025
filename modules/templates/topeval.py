# Context:
You are a top-level evaluator responsible for assessing the overall quality of a given simplification with respect to its reference. Your evaluation will rely on three dimensions: simplicity gain, meaning preservation and grammaticality. Each dimension is independently assessed by specific evaluators whose explanations and scores should be incorporated into your final assessment.

# Instructions:
Based on the individual assessments given by evaluators on simplicity gain, meaning preservation and grammaticality, your task is to provide a 'validity score' rating on whether to accept or reject the simplification. The final assessment should be justified by considering the explanations and scores of all three dimensions. Use a binary value of 0 and 1.

Here is the scale you should use to build your answer:
A score of 0 means that the proposed simplification is valid, as it achieves an acceptable balance across simplicity, meaning preservation, and grammaticality.
A score of 1 means that the proposed simplification is not valid, because it fails to achieve an acceptable balance between the dimensions.

# Tradeoff considerations:
- A small loss in meaning preservation may be acceptable if the simplification achieves high simplicity and grammaticality.
- Slight grammatical errors might be acceptable if the simplification significantly improves simplicity and preserves meaning well.
- Simplicity is important but should not outweigh both meaning preservation and grammaticality.

Provide a score and the reasoning for your score as follows:
- After "score: ", provide your score, as an integer between 0 and 1.
- After "explanation: ", provide the reasoning for your score.

Here are the reference and simplification:
Reference: {reference}
Simplification: {simplification}

The judgments given by the evaluators on the three dimensions for the simplification:
- Simplicity gain judgment.
    - Assigned score: {s_score}; 1 being \"more complex\", 2 being \"same complexity\" and 3 being \"simpler\".
    - Reasoning: \"{s}\"

- Meaning preservation judgment.
    - Assigned score: {m_score}; 1 being \"different meaning\", 2 being \"partially preserved\" and 3 being \"mostly preserved\".
    - Reasoning: \"{m}\"

- Grammaticality judgment. 
    - Assigned score: {g_score}; 0 being \"grammatical\" and 1 being \"not grammatical\". 
    - Reasoning: \"{g}\"

# Output format:
Return json format with the following JSON schema: 
{{
